# Project for MDPH 612

## Project Concept

In this project, we aim to develop a web-app, with which medical physicists can use various optimizers to optimize their HDR BT treatment plans. In addition to using different optimizers, the user can also edit the needle configuration in each of their treatment plans using our graphical user interface. The performance of each optimizer is evaluated using DVH, D95, D1cc for each OAR, and the length of optimization time. In addition, we aim to render the contribution of each needle to the overall quality of the treatment plan on a digitized HDR BT needle template. After the optimization process, the user can donate their treatment plans to a public database of HDR BT treatment plans, where other users can benefit from the publicly available data
